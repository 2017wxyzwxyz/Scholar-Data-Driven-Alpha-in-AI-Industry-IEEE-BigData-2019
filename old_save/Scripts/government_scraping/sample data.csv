The first kind of information is the displacement between a     pixel site in the current frame and the corresponding site in me previous     or next frame. This is the motion vector at that site. The second is an     indication of whether that pixel is occluded or not in the previous or     next frames.

Acoustic presence verification is used to assure that a device attempting     to remotely deactivate an alarm is located within a certain distance of     an alarming device before allowing the alarm to be hushed. Acoustic     presence can be established through emission and monitoring of ultrasonic     acoustic signals. The ultrasonic acoustic signals may be transmitted at a     frequency that exceeds human hearing such as, for example, between 18 kHz     and 22 kHz. Such ultrasonic signals have a relatively short range and are     unable to penetrate walls and floors, thus providing an effective tool     for ensuring that the device attempting to remotely hush an alarming     device is within a line-of-sight of the alarming device.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=179&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&p=4&S1=(%22Artificial+Intelligence%22+AND+Google.ASNM.)&OS=&RS=

The processing system may cause the light to     illuminate based on the selected illumination state. The processing     system may determine a gesture has been performed in the ambient     environment of the hazard detector following the light being illuminated     based on the selected illumination state. The processing system may     output a detail of the status via the speaker corresponding to the     illumination state in response to determining the gesture has been     performed.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=4&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&p=1&S1=(%22Artificial+Intelligence%22+AND+Google.ASNM.)&OS=&RS=

In one aspect, a method includes the actions of     receiving audio data corresponding to an utterance. The method further     includes generating frequency domain data using the audio data. The     method further includes processing the frequency domain data using     complex linear projection. The method further includes providing the     processed frequency domain data to a neural network trained as an     acoustic model. The method further includes generating a transcription     for the utterance that is determined based at least on output that the     neural network provides in response to receiving the processed frequency     domain data.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=3&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&p=1&S1=(%22Artificial+Intelligence%22+AND+Google.ASNM.)&OS=&RS=

When editing a setpoint the     user's input is constrained such that the user can only alter one     parameter (either time or temperature). As soon as the user begins to     drag a setpoint icon in either a horizontal (i.e. adjusting time), or     vertical (i.e. adjusting temperature), the other parameter is     constrained. Additionally, the disclosed user interface includes     displaying information as to how the setpoint was most recently added or     adjusted. For example the display can be used to indicate whether a     setpoint was added or adjusted (1) on the thermostat itself; (2) by an     automated learning algorithm; (3) by a user on a web client; or (4) by a     user using a mobile client (such as a smart phone or tablet PC).
